In my spare time I work on some open source [projects](/projects.html) (most of
them are pretty simple and available on my
[bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/zserge) page).

If I feel like I want to write something, and this is not about writing code - 
I publish some thoughs in [my blog](/blog.html).
