Normally, people don't read 'hello' posts. I consider them useless, they teach
nothing, mean nothing but still take time to write and to read. So, I strongly
hope that I will be the only person who read this.

I started another blog. I already have [one](http://zserge.wordpress.com) (in
Russian), but I hope they both will co-exists in future. Some posts will be
translated, some will be adopted, others will not. Anyway, I can't promise too
much, but the idea of this site/blog seems to be inspiring at the moment.

One day I realized that I'm so happily employed that have an extermely outdated
CV, and all the stuff I do is just scattered all over the internet, some
projects took the shelter only on my localhost machine, some ideas were just
told to a couple of friends and since then are shared by word of mouth.

That's why I started this site/blog. I will try to gather together here all my
projects and thoughs, tools and toys, fresh and mossy code, wise and stupid
ideas. Hope you'll like them.
