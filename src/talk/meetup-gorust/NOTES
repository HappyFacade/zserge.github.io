//Typing is no substitute for thinking
//If it wasn't for C, we'd be writing programs in BASI, PASAL, and OBOL.
//C is not a high-level language."    — Kernighan.
//Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++ ???
//What is the object oriented way of getting rich ? — Inheritance.
//C(++) is a write-only, high-level assembler language
//Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing.  (Pike)
//Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. (SICP)
//Real programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand
//"VisualBasic is so easy to use - all you need is a spacebar and a forehead." 
//"It would be difficult to construe this as a feature."  (Wall)
//"There is no silver bullet." 
//"Just because a thing can be done, doesn't mean that it should be done." 
//"Given ten days for a project, a good engineer spends nine days figuring out how to finish it in one day."
//The First Rule of Program Optimization
//    Don't do it.

//    The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only)
//        Don't do it yet. 
//"The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to chose from." (Tannenbaum)
//There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.
//The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. 
//Deleted code is debugged code. 
//A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.
//Существуют только два вида языков: невыносимые и неиспользуемые
//Java - Write once — debug everywhere.
