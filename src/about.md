Hi! I'm Serge.

I'm one part of the [Trikita] duet - together with Anna we make software, which
is lightweight, simple, yet useful and fun.

<!-- list of projects here -->

My development life style is spinning around unix-like systems and C-like
languages. I also do embedded systems development, android apps and web apps.

Besides programming I like music and play a little guitar/piano. Also I like
reading good books.
