Hi! I'm Serge.

I am a computer programmer who writes code for people, not the machines. I
appreciate minimal and elegant solutions to complex problems.

My development life style is spinning around unix-like systems and C-like
languages. I also do embedded systems development, android apps and web apps.

Besides programming I am an amateur musician playing a little guitar/piano.
And when I'm deprived of anything that can make a sound - I enjoy the silence
while reading good books.
