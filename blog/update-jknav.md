I like Vim and I like using 'J' and 'K' to scroll text down and up.

I know about Vimperator/Vimium, but they seem too powerful to me.
That's why I started my [NIH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)
browser extension. At the moment, Firefox and Chrome are supported.

Here's [the project page](/jknav.html), and here are 
[the sources](https://bitbucket.org/zserge/jknav).

Any advice or comments welcome!
